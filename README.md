# WESAD_model

This project aims to leverage the WESAD (WEarable Stress and Affect Detection) dataset to develop personalized machine learning models that accurately predict stress levels for individuals. By analyzing physiological and demographic data collected through wearable sensors, the project seeks to understand the variance in stress responses among different subjects. The goal is to create a robust model for each individual that effectively distinguishes between stress and non-stress states, potentially contributing to personalized stress management solutions.
